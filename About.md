# About The Notebook

This notebook reads a CSV file containing information about various houses that are on sale in

Bangalore at the time of this project. The aim is to build a machine learning model that will

predict the price of a house based on various factors like bhk, the total square feet, the number of

bathrooms, the number of balconies available, and the location.
